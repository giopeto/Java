Exp
JS
1. javascript engine(how javascript works)
2. Do javascript have threads
3. Typescript one variable with multiple types (var x : int | String)
4. Default value on variable (var x = callSomeFunction || 1)
5. Typescript compile and runtime(typescript is not available on run time)
6. Store(redux or something like this) vs local storage or read data to file
7. Redux store
Java
6. Put variable at some position in array. {1, 2, 3} become {1, 42, 2, 3}
